# OOT Remake

A build of Lichii dedicated to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on Switch 2 (program id
0400486024DEC000). Launched without arguments, `OOT Remake.exe` asks once for your dump (NSP/XCI
or the exefs `main`) and then boots it directly. The built-in Max Resolution and Dynamic FPS
patches are applied to build E0F3CCFAF50065AE4EA01EB5AEB13B1A45DA3348. Keys, firmware and the
game are not included: use your own dump.

The build is always portable: all data (config, keys, firmware/NAND, saves, shader cache, logs)
lives in the `portable` folder next to `OOT Remake.exe`, created on first launch. Put
`prod.keys` and `title.keys` in `portable\keys`.

Windows needs the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x64). It is not bundled: if
`OOT Remake.exe` reports a missing `MSVCP140.dll` or `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, install it from
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe. Windows builds come from the `oot-windows` workflow
(Actions tab, artifact `OOT-Remake-windows-*`).

Djipi builds are based on [Lichii](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii) (zortos293),
[Frizti's fork](https://github.com/Frizti/Lichii), Eglantine, Eden and yuzu, all GPL-3.0; the
source keeps their copyright notices.

Everything below is the upstream Lichii README.

# Lichii

Lichii is an experimental, open-source Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 emulator written in C++. It builds on Eglantine, Eden, yuzu and Sudachi, preserving their contributions while developing this fork's game compatibility and renderer fixes.

This is an independent fork, not an official release of those upstream projects. Lichii is not affiliated with Nintendo.

## Downloads and setup

Download Lichii only from this repository's [releases page](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/releases). Lichii has no other download site: archives offered elsewhere, such as lichii.org, are not built by this project, and one has been reported to install malware ([#545](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/issues/545)).

On Windows, extract the entire build archive and run **lichii.exe**. Only use games and system files you have legally obtained. Games, keys and firmware are not included.

### Existing saves and settings

The rebrand intentionally retains the existing Eden/Eglantine data directories and configuration keys. It does not move or delete saves, settings or shader caches. Back up your saves before testing experimental builds.

## Compatibility and issue reports

Compatibility and performance vary by game, hardware and driver. Rendering errors, stutters and crashes remain possible. Passing automated tests does not establish that a game renders correctly, and this project makes no universal frame-rate guarantee.

When [reporting an issue](https://github.com/zortos293/Eglantine/issues), include:

- The exact build, game version, CPU, GPU and driver version.
- Relevant settings and steps to reproduce the problem.
- A screenshot and the log from the affected session, after checking it for personal information.

Do not upload game files, keys, firmware or private account information.

## Building and contributing

See the [build guide](docs/Build.md), [user documentation](docs/user/README.md) and [coding guidelines](docs/Coding.md). Some inherited documentation and internal build target names still use upstream names. The GUI build target remains `yuzu`; its output is `lichii.exe` on Windows and `lichii` on other desktop platforms.

Keep changes focused and distinguish code-level checks from actual gameplay testing.

## Artwork
Art created by YOB (yobslab)
The supplied Lichii logo, icon and library artwork are in [dist/branding](dist/branding). Windows, Linux and macOS icon resources are generated from that artwork by [Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1](tools/Generate-LichiiIcons.ps1).

## Support Lichii

Lichii is free and stays free. If you want to help, you can donate in crypto. Donations help pay for the AI tools and build machines used to develop this open-source project faster.
